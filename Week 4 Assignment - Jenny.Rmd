# We can see that the radiation from 200 to 300 occurs most frequently.

# Boxplot: code referenced Chapter 7 from R for Everyone
boxplot(envir$temperature)
# The boxplot of temerature shows us the median of temperature is around 78.


# Scatterplots: code referenced Chapter 7 from R for Everyone
plot(temperature ~ wind, data = envir)
# From the scatterplots, we can see that there is no obvious relationship between temperature and wind.
